## 📊 Visualizations & Insights
### 1️⃣ Line Chart – Sales Trend Over Time
Shows how sales change month by month

Helps identify growth patterns

Insight:
Sales increase consistently over time, indicating steady business growth.

### 2️⃣ Bar Chart – Monthly Profit Comparison
Compares profit across months

Insight:
Profit rises gradually, reflecting improved operational efficiency.

### 3️⃣ Histogram – Sales Distribution
Displays the frequency distribution of sales values

Insight:
Most sales values fall in the higher range, showing strong overall performance.

### 4️⃣ Scatter Plot – Sales vs Profit Relationship
Shows correlation between sales and profit

Insight:
A positive correlation exists — higher sales lead to higher profit.
