## 📌 VERY IMPORTANT (Do This to Avoid Spacing Issues)

### ✅ Before Committing:
- ❌ No empty line before `# CodeAlpha Task 1 – Web Scraping`
- ❌ No spaces before headings
- ✅ Screenshots folder name must be exactly `screenshots`

---

## ✅ How This Will Look on GitHub
✔ No big gap at top  
✔ Headings aligned properly  
✔ Screenshots displayed correctly  
✔ Clean & professional  

This is **exactly what evaluators want** 💯

I can:
- Review **Task 2 / Task 3 README**
- Fix **any Markdown file**
- Write **main repository README**
- Help with **LinkedIn post & video script**

```
